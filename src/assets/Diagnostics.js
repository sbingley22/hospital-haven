export const diseaseInfo = {
  "Angina": "Patients experience chest pain or discomfort, often triggered by physical exertion or stress. Key tests include T-wave abnormalities in the ECG and partial obstruction in coronary arteries seen during coronary angiography.",
  "Anemia": "Patients may complain of tiredness, pale skin, and a bounding pulse. Diagnostic tests include bloodwork showing low hemoglobin, low ferritin, and low iron levels.",
  "Appendicitis": "Patients typically present with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. Key diagnostic tools are an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan showing an inflamed appendix.",
  "Asthma": "Common symptoms include wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, often worsened by allergens or exercise. Diagnosis can be confirmed with a spirometry test showing a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio and positive allergy tests.",
  "Cholecystitis": "Symptoms include severe right upper quadrant pain, fever, and nausea. Diagnostic tests such as an abdominal ultrasound will show thickened gallbladder walls, and a HIDA scan may demonstrate reduced gallbladder function.",
  "COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)": "Symptoms include chronic cough, difficulty breathing, and wheezing. A spirometry test typically shows a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio, and chest X-ray may show hyperinflated lungs.",
  "Diabetes Mellitus": "Patients may report excessive thirst, frequent urination, and unexplained weight loss. Key tests include elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c levels, as well as glucose in the urine.",
  "Hypothyroidism": "Patients commonly present with fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Blood tests will show low T3 and T4 levels with elevated TSH, and thyroid ultrasound may reveal diffuse thyroid enlargement.",
  "IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome)": "Patients often complain of abdominal pain, bloating, and irregular bowel movements. Stool tests and blood work usually show normal results, with a colonoscopy revealing no visible abnormalities.",
  "Kidney Stones": "Patients may report severe flank pain and hematuria. Diagnostic imaging such as a non-contrast CT or ultrasound can confirm the presence of stones in the urinary tract.",
  "Migraine": "Patients may experience a severe, pulsating headache, often with light sensitivity and nausea. MRI or CT scan may be used to rule out other causes, but results are typically normal.",
  "Myocardial Infarction": "Patients can present with chest pain radiating to the left arm and jaw, shortness of breath, or even be unconscious. Look for elevated troponin levels in their bloods and STEMIs in their ECG.",
  "Pancreatitis": "Patients present with severe abdominal pain that radiates to the back, along with nausea and vomiting. Blood tests often show elevated lipase and amylase levels, while abdominal imaging may reveal pancreatic inflammation.",
  "Peptic Ulcer Disease": "Patients may have upper abdominal pain and nausea. An endoscopy may reveal ulceration in the stomach lining, and a urea breath test can confirm the presence of H. pylori infection.",
  "Pulmonary Embolism": "Symptoms include sudden-onset shortness of breath, chest pain, and coughing up blood. Diagnosis can be made with an elevated D-dimer and clots visible on a CT pulmonary angiography.",
  "Sepsis": "Patients may present with fever, rapid heart rate, confusion, and low blood pressure. Blood cultures may reveal bacterial infection, and lactate levels in the blood will be elevated.",
  "UTI (Urinary Tract Infection)": "Common symptoms include painful urination, frequent urge to urinate, and cloudy urine. Urinalysis will typically show white blood cells and bacteria, and urine culture may identify E. coli.",
